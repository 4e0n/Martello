# Martello

Martello is a C++/Qt-based application for flying a Ryzen-Tello Quadropter via EEG BCI.

Development (TODO) is a two-step process:
1. Traditional GUI-user interface with videostream and controls will be implemented.
2. EEG classified features (via Scikit/Python) will be applied in real-time for control over BCI.
